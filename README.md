# NXTOpenCube
Solve cubes with lego.

This project arose out of a discussion on the Rebrickable project:

https://rebrickable.com/mocs/MOC-10876/hitchhiker/nxt-cube-machine-cube-solver/#comments

Hitchhiker, the original creator of the MOC, was good enough to supply me with his original source code for the Android APK.

All original source is the work of Hitchhiker (a.k.a. Manfred Matuszek).

The NxtCubeMachineCode.zip file is Hitchhiker's original source archive.
